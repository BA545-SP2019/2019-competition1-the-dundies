---Notes---
Each submission contains: 1. Data file modified by the group
                          2. Python workflow and/or any other code used by the group
                          3. Detailed comments and description of the code used
                          
Measured on: Prediction Accuracy & Predictive Power (Each worth 100 points towards total 200 points for Comptetion)



----Major Notes----

Research Question: "What are the determinants of IPO underpricing phenomena?"
    - The main purpose of this competition is to prepare the data for predictive models answering the research question

  ##Steps that have been suggested for us to take##
      - Descriptive Statistics: describe the data using the mean, mode, 1st|3rd quartiles, standard deviation, etc. ...
      - Imputation: dealing with missing data (WE ARE NOT GOING TO DROP ANY COLUMNS DUE TO MISSING DATA)
                   - We could:
                       1. Fill in the missing data with the mean/median/mode, depending on the data type
                       2. Use linear regression predictions in a continuous data type column
      - Normalization: We will need to normalize all continuous variable fields to allow a normal distribution
                       1. We will need to remove skewness (using logarithm, square root, etc.)
                       2. Make sure the residual is randomly distributed
      - Correlation Analysis: need to select predictor variables with low-pair wise correlation values (usually the threshold is 0.5)
      - Standardization: need to convert the values at the same numeric level; can use the z-score standardization method
      - Recoding: we should recode any categorical data (they are usually binary); but categorical data should not have more than 5 classes
