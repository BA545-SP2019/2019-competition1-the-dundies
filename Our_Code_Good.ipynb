    "According to Investopedia.com, Underpricing is the listing of an intial public offering (IPO) below its market value. When the offer price of the stock is lower than the price of the first trade, the stock is considered to be underpriced. This will only last for a short amount of time, as the demand of the stock is going to drive it back up to its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a company standpoint, they wish to have the intial public offering as high as possible, which in turn raises the most capital. The quantitative factors that go into an initial public offering are all financial analysis reports from the company itself. Before the IPO, the company will be analyzed by its sales, expenses, earnings, and cash flow. Furthermore, a company's earnings and expected earnings growth are the biggest factors in the IPO. Marketability in a specific industry and the general market also can drive an IPO up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the investment bankers or IPO underwriters determine the IPO price of the company's stock, the day before the stock is offered publically, the company will market the IPO to potential investors. For historical purposes, IPOs are viewed as risky investments because of the lack of historical data that is collected on them. The less liquidity that the stock/company has and predicatble IPO shares are going to be, the more likely they are going to be underprices to compensate for assumed risk. Company's also underprice their IPO to entice more investors to buy stocks to raise more capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this information about intial public offerings, is there a few determinants that can be identified as to why the phenomenon of underpricing exists? The dataset that we have been provided provide information about companies and information regarding their IPO, such as IPO Offering, IPO Characteristics, Textual Characterisitics, Sentiment Characteristics, Target Variables, Control Variables, and IPO Identifiers.\n",
